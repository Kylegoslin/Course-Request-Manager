Course Request Manager for Moodle

by Kyle Goslin & Daniel McSweeney

------------------------------------------------



  CRM Current Version 4.2
  For Moodle: 2.5+
  Tested on: Moodle 2.7


------------------------------------------------


Description:

This block is allows administrators to streamline the course creation
process at the start of the semester by allowing educators to make
requests for courses to be created.

Once requested, the Moodle administrator is responsible for accepting or 
denying requests for courses. If the administrator is not happy, a comment 
feature allows a conversation to take place between them and the educator about
the pending request.

During the process of creating a course request, additional information 
about the course can be collected from the educator such as course title, 
course codes and semester information. This block also offers additional 
customizable fields to allow the administrator to collect additional course 
information.
